# Statistical mechanics for the Ginzburg-Landau equation

Submitted as part of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford.

--------------------------

This repository accompanies the report "Statistical mechanics for the Ginzburg-Landau equation". I reproduce and explain the results of [1], in which the authors propose an equilibrium statistical mechanics methodology to describe far-from-equilibrium systems, using the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as a model example.
